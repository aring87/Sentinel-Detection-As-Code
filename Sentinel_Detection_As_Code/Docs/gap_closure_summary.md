# Gap Closure Summary

This summary outlines the improvements made to Sentinel detection rules by incorporating 14 new detections across various CKC and MITRE ATT&CK phases.

## ✅ Detections Added by Phase

| Phase                   | Techniques Added |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Reconnaissance         | 3                |
| Initial Access         | 4                |
| Execution              | 5                |
| Privilege Escalation   | 1                |
| Defense Evasion        | 2                |
| Credential Access      | 3                |
| Discovery              | 2                |
| Collection             | 1                |
| Command and Control    | 3                |
| Exfiltration           | 1                |

These rules strengthen the environment’s detection maturity by:
- Covering gaps in earlier phases like Recon and Initial Access
- Increasing visibility into Execution and C2 channels
- Improving alignment with MITRE ATT&CK for threat modeling
